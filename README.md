# GoogleCodingChallenge
BrightNetwork Internship Experience - Google coding challenge (Youtube commandline interface)
Self-evaluation: I'm proud of how I did in this challenge because I managed to pass all the unit-tests, and more importantly, I improved my understanding of Python in the process. I made sure to try out slightly more advanced features of Python which I hadn't used before, such as lambda functions, filter(), and map(). I also think my code is reasonably clean, but could do with a lot more comments!
